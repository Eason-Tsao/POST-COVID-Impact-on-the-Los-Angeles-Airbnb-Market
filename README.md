# POST-COVID-Impact-on-the-Los-Angeles-Airbnb-Market
This project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Airbnb market in Los Angeles. Key focus areas include trends in active listings, booking patterns, and price changes.

# Key Findings
* Active Listings Trend: The Home-Sharing Ordinance in 2019 caused a significant drop in listings, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Booking Trend: A notable decrease in bookings was observed in 2020, suggesting many hosts either left the platform or had fewer bookings.
* Price Analysis: Despite a drop in demand, average prices increased in 2020 due to reduced supply and higher minimum stay requirements.
